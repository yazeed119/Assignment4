- In the beginning, I created the color class, with the three colors known for their value: 
  red, green and blue.


And I gave a value for each color, 
which is the same color, 
and then I wrote the sitter and the gitter for the colors, and the override.


- In the other class: Color Store, I created a setter for the Copy, 
- which is the color to be cloned, and then I wrote the added function, 
- which represents the mixing of colors.
